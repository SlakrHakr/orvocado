Some examples of gun control throughout colonial America included criminalizing the transfer of guns to Catholics, slaves, indentured servants, and Native Americans; regulating the storage of gun powder in homes; banning loaded guns in Boston houses; and mandating participation in formal gathering of troops and door-to-door surveys about guns owned.   In the June 26, 2008 District of Columbia et al. v. Heller US Supreme Court majority opinion, Justice Antonin Scalia, LLB, wrote, "Like most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited. From Blackstone through the 19th-century cases, commentators and courts routinely explained that the right was not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose… nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms."  On June 9, 2016 the US Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 7-4 that "[t]he right of the general public to carry a concealed firearm in public is not, and never has been, protected by the Second Amendment," thus upholding a law requiring a permitting process and "good cause" for concealed carry licenses in California.

Game controllers are so sophisticated and the games are so realistic that simulating the violent acts enhances the learning of those violent behaviors.  A 2015 peer-reviewed study found "compelling evidence that the use of realistic controllers can have a significant effect on the level of cognitive aggression."

Clinton fought to bridge the "digital divide," an inequality of access to technology that would make poor people even more disadvantaged in education and employment opportunities. His policies helped schools and libraries introduce computers and the internet to people who wouldn\'t otherwise have had access. ')

As proof that the reform was successful, 10 years after he signed the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, welfare rolls had dropped from 12.2 million to 4.5 million. ')
Reason.create(position_id: 71, description: 'Taxes: The $290 billion national deficit of 1992 became a $124 billion surplus by 1999 because Clinton\'s Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 raised taxes on the top income rate from 28 percent to 39.6 percent, thus increasing tax revenues.   Just as the 1980s economic boom followed a tax increase by Reagan, the economy likewise improved after Clinton raised taxes in 1993.  He also limited the ability of corporations to claim deductions for entertainment expenses. ')

He sought to hunt down bin Laden after the Oct. 12, 2000 attack on the USS Cole, but the CIA and FBI refused to certify bin Laden\'s involvement in the terrorist act. "I got closer to killing him than anybody\'s gotten since," Clinton said in a Sep. 24, 2006 interview with Chris Wallace. ')
Reason.create(position_id: 72, description: 'Character: Constant scandals took Clinton\'s focus off running the country. When Paula Jones sued Clinton for sexual harassment, he became the first sitting president to testify before a grand jury investigating his own conduct.  An affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky culminated in Clinton\'s impeachment by the House of Representatives on Dec. 19, 1998 on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice. The only other president in US history to be impeached was Andrew Johnson in 1868.  Some blame Clinton\'s moral shortcomings for disenfranchising Democratic Party members and Independents, and causing Al Gore to lose the 2000 presidential election. ')

Resources were geared towards incarceration instead of rehabilitation or crime prevention.  Clinton\'s 1994 Crime Bill was filled with "pork spending" that distributed $10 billion to states and special interest groups. ')
Reason.create(position_id: 72, description: 'Defense: Clinton was unable to fulfill his campaign promise to repeal the ban on homosexuals serving in the military. Faced with strong opposition from conservatives early in his presidency, Clinton settled on a compromise policy referred to as "don\'t ask, don\'t tell," which allowed gays to serve in the military if they did not disclose their sexual orientation. Neither conservatives nor liberals were satisfied by the outcome. ')

The Republican-controlled Congress helped improve the economy by exercising fiscal restraint.  Clinton\'s failure to regulate the financial-services markets enabled the bad lending and Wall Street scams that led to the 2007 banking crisis. ')
Reason.create(position_id: 72, description: 'Education: Clinton\'s Goals 2000 program did not ensure uniform quality of standards among all the states because he compromised on oversight to get the program passed. The impact therefore varied by state and Clinton never fulfilled his goal of equalizing education standards and improving results for all students. By 2000, six years after IASA was implemented, only 17 states were in full compliance with the standards. ')

NAFTA resulted in more air pollution on the US/Mexico border, which experts estimated would cost $15 billion to clean up.  Clinton also signed a 1995 measure to allow logging in national forests which suspended environmental laws protecting those forests. ')
Reason.create(position_id: 72, description: 'Foreign Policy: A year after 18 American troops were killed in a failed 1993 mission to capture a warlord in Somalia, Clinton was hesitant to take action to stop a genocide in Rwanda. While he failed to act, more than half a million Tutsis were murdered. Critics accused Clinton of appeasement when he gave China Most Favored Nation (MFN) status despite their terrible human rights record and when he granted North Korea concessions in exchange for a promise to discontinue their nuclear weapons program.

Reason.create(position_id: 72, description: 'Health: Health care reform was Clinton\'s major goal when he took office but his administration was ill-prepared for such a large task and made several missteps. Republican opposition was insurmountable and Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D-ME) declared on Sep. 26, 1994 that Clinton\'s plan would never pass. The failure is considered the biggest of his administration in part because it led to the Republicans regaining control of Congress in the next election but also because he expended a lot of political capital without getting anything in return.

Some blame the 2003 Space Shuttle Columbia explosion on Clinton\'s decision to slash NASA\'s budget by an aggregate of $56 million over his presidency. ')

The 1993 tax hikes cannot be credited with the economic boom of the 1990s: it was after the Republican Congress passed tax cuts in 1997 that the economy really became stronger and the budget was balanced.

A former CIA station chief in Pakistan said Clinton ordered the CIA to capture bin Laden alive, which resulted in a missed opportunity to kill him at an al-Qaida training camp in 2000. ')
